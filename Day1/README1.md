 What Happens When You Run a Python Program?
Imagine you write a simple Python code like this:

python
Copy
Edit
print("Hello, Anshu!")
Now let’s peek behind the curtain and understand what actually happens inside Python when you run this line.

🧠 Python Internals: Step-by-Step
Python works in four main stages when running your code:

1. Source Code (Your .py file)
You write your Python code in a file with .py extension. This is called source code, and it's written in human-readable language (like English + logic).

python
Copy
Edit
print("Hello, Anshu!")
👉 But computers don’t understand this directly — they understand machine code (0s and 1s). So Python has to convert your code into something it can actually run.

2. Compilation to Bytecode
When you run your Python program, it first gets compiled into an intermediate format called bytecode.

Bytecode is not machine code yet.

It's more like a translated version of your code that's easier for the Python system to understand.

It looks something like: LOAD_NAME, CALL_FUNCTION, RETURN_VALUE (not readable for humans).

Python stores this bytecode in .pyc files (in the __pycache__ folder).

🔹 Think of bytecode like a recipe written in shorthand — it’s not food, and it’s not in plain language, but a trained chef (the Python Virtual Machine) knows exactly what to do with it.

3. Python Virtual Machine (PVM)
Now comes the hero of Python’s internal system — the PVM (Python Virtual Machine).

👨‍🍳 Think of PVM as a chef who takes your shorthand recipe (bytecode) and executes it line by line to cook your final dish (the output).

📌 The PVM:

Reads the bytecode.

Executes each instruction.

Manages memory, variables, functions, etc.

Produces output like: Hello, Anshu!

So basically:

Source Code → Bytecode → PVM executes → Output

🧱 Key Components of Python Architecture
Here are the main pieces inside Python:

🔸 1. Parser
Breaks your source code into tokens (words like print, "Anshu").

Checks if the syntax is correct.

Converts it into something called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

🪵 Think of the AST like the blueprint of a house.

🔸 2. Compiler
Converts the AST into bytecode.

Bytecode is stored in .pyc files for faster future runs.

🔸 3. Interpreter / Python Virtual Machine (PVM)
Reads the bytecode and runs it.

Handles memory, function calls, exceptions, etc.

🧠 It’s like your brain reading a to-do list and doing tasks one by one.

🔸 4. Memory Manager
Python has a built-in memory manager that:

Allocates memory when you create variables.

Cleans up unused memory using something called Garbage Collection.

🧹 Python automatically deletes stuff you don’t use anymore to free up space.

🔸 5. Standard Library
A huge collection of pre-written code.

Example: math, random, datetime, etc.

📦 Think of it as a big toolbox that comes free with Python.

📄 Summary Table: Python’s Inner Working
Stage	What Happens
Write Code	You write .py file with source code
Parsing	Python breaks it into tokens and checks syntax
Compilation	Converts to bytecode (intermediate format)
PVM Execution	PVM reads bytecode and executes instructions line by line
Output	You see the result printed, returned, or displayed

🎯 Real-Life Analogy
Let’s say you want to cook “Pasta”:

You write the recipe → This is your .py file (source code)

You translate the recipe into chef’s shorthand → This is the bytecode

The chef (PVM) follows the shorthand to cook → This is PVM executing the bytecode

You eat the pasta → This is the final output of your Python program!

🧪 Behind the Scenes (Advanced Sneak Peek)
If you're curious about what tools run all this:

CPython: Most commonly used version of Python. It's written in C.

Other versions:

Jython – Python for Java

IronPython – Python for .NET

PyPy – Fast Python with Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler

But don’t worry about these now — just know that you're likely using CPython.

✅ Key Takeaways
Python code is not executed directly — it’s compiled into bytecode, then run by the PVM.

The PVM is like a smart engine that understands Python’s special language.

Python is designed to abstract all this so you can just write and run code easily.

This system makes Python beginner-friendly, powerful, and flexible.
