# 📘 Mutable vs Immutable in Python

Understanding how Python handles memory and object references is essential for writing efficient and bug-free code.

## 🔸 Definitions

### Immutable – Unchangeable  
Once created, the object **cannot** be modified in place.

**Examples**:
- `int`
- `float`
- `str`
- `tuple`
- `bool`

### Mutable – Changeable  
You **can** change the content of the object without creating a new one.

**Examples**:
- `list`
- `dict`
- `set`
- `bytearray`

## 🧠 How Python Handles Memory

Every time you create a variable:

- Python creates an object in memory.
- Assigns it a unique ID (`id()`).
- Your variable acts as a label pointing to that memory address.

---

## 📦 Immutable Objects: Stored Once, Reused Often

```python
a = 10
b = 10

print(id(a))  # e.g., 140734627083888
print(id(b))  # Same as above
Since integers are immutable, Python reuses the same object in memory (a technique called interning).

Changing a:

python
a = 11
print(id(a))  # New memory address
✅ New object created ✅ b still points to the original 10

📦 Mutable Objects: Change Content Inside
python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x
x.append(4)

print(y)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
✅ Both x and y point to the same list object ✅ Changes to x affect y

🔬 Python’s Memory Model
Each object in Python has:

Type → Type of object (int, list, etc.)

ID → Memory location (id())

Value → The actual data stored

Example:

python
name = "Anshu"
print(type(name))  # <class 'str'>
print(id(name))    # Unique memory address
🎯 Key Functions
Function	Purpose
id()	Shows memory address
type()	Shows object type
is	Checks if two variables refer to the same object
==	Checks if values are equal
python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]

print(a == b)  # True – same value
print(a is b)  # False – different objects
⚙️ Behind the Scenes
🧮 Reference Counting
Python tracks how many references point to an object. When the count hits zero, garbage collection deletes the object.

python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x
del x
del y
# The list is now deleted – no references remain
🔁 Visual Comparison
Immutable Example
a = 10 → memory: [10]
b = 10 → points to same [10]

a = 15 → new object [15]
b still → [10]
Mutable Example
x = [1, 2] → memory: [[1, 2]]
y = x → same list

x.append(3) → [[1, 2, 3]]
y also sees the change
🔧 Real-World DevOps Analogy
Immutable = Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
python
image1 = "Ubuntu-18.04"
image2 = image1
image1 = "Ubuntu-20.04"  # new image created
Mutable = Docker Volume
python
volume1 = {"log": "initial"}
volume2 = volume1
volume1["log"] = "updated"

print(volume2["log"])  # Output: updated
📝 Summary
Property	Mutable	Immutable
Can be modified?	✅ Yes	❌ No
Examples	list, dict, set	int, str, tuple, bool
Memory reuse	🟥 No	✅ Yes (interning)
Performance	May be slower	Faster (less allocation)
Memory behavior	New copy per object	Shared if value same
💡 Pro Tips
Use immutable types for security and performance.

Use mutable types for flexibility in configs and logs.

Variables are labels pointing to objects — not containers.

Happy coding! 🐍✨
