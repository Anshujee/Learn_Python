# Understanding Python Data Types

# A data type in Python is essentially a category that defines what kind of value a variable can hold. Think of data types as labels that tell Python how to treat different kinds of data. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don’t need to declare the data type explicitly — Python figures it out based on the assigned value.

# Core Data Types in Python

# Python offers several built-in data types, grouped broadly into the following categories:

# 1. Numeric Types

# int: Used for whole numbers (e.g., 5, -42, 1000).

# float: Used for decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5).

# complex: Used for complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g., 2 + 3j).

# Use Case:

# In DevOps automation, numeric types can help in metrics calculation (e.g., monitoring CPU usage percentage or RAM utilization).



# 2. Sequence Types

# str: Used for text data (e.g., 'Hello World').

# list: An ordered collection that can hold different data types (e.g., [1, 'hello', 3.14]).

# tuple: Similar to lists but immutable (e.g., (1, 2, 3)).

# Use Case:

# Lists are great for storing configurations, paths, or file names in automated scripts.

# Strings are frequently used for log parsing, file path handling, and dynamic output generation.



# 3. Mapping Type

# dict: Stores key-value pairs (e.g., {'name': 'Anshu', 'age': 30}).

# Use Case:

# Useful for managing environment variables, AWS credentials, or JSON data in APIs.



# 4. Set Types

# set: An unordered collection of unique items (e.g., {1, 2, 3}).

# frozenset: Similar to set, but immutable. immutable that doesn't change after execution.

# Use Case:

# Sets are great for deduplication when handling large logs or datasets.



# 5. Boolean Type

# bool: Represents True or False values.

# Use Case:

# Booleans are essential for conditional logic in deployment scripts or automation.


# 6. Binary Types

# bytes, bytearray, memoryview: Used for handling binary data like images, files, or network packets.

# Use Case:

# Useful in scenarios like file uploads, encryption, or when working with APIs that require binary data.

# 7. None Type

# None: Represents the absence of a value. It’s often used to initialize variables or as a default return value.

# Use Case:

# In DevOps, None can be used to check if certain environment variables are missing or not set.
