# Python Variables
# In Python, variables are used to store data that can be referenced 
# and manipulated during program execution. A variable is essentially 
# a name that is assigned to a value. 
# Variables act as placeholders for data. 
# They allow us to store and reuse values in our program.
#Example:


# Variable 'x' stores the integer value 10

x = 5

# Variable 'name' stores the string "Samantha"

name = "Samantha"  

print(x)

print(name)
