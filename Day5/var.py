# Python Variables
# In Python, variables are used to store data that can be referenced 
# and manipulated during program execution. A variable is essentially 
# a name that is assigned to a value. 
# Variables act as placeholders for data. 
# They allow us to store and reuse values in our program.
#Example:


# Variable 'x' stores the integer value 10

x = 5

# Variable 'name' stores the string "Samantha"

name = "Samantha"  

print(x)

print(name)

# Dynamic Typing
# Python variables are dynamically typed, meaning the same variable 
# can hold different types of values during execution.
# In Python, dynamic typing means that the type of a variable is determined 
# at runtime, and you donâ€™t need to explicitly declare the type. 
# The same variable can hold different types of values throughout execution.

x = 10
x = "Now a string"
print (x)
print (x)
